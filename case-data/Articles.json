In the large majority of those suits, about 95 percent, Juul is named as a defendant. The main cause of action for the cases, cited in at least 2,011 lawsuits, is Product Liability. Other case types include antitrust, intellectual property, and suits brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Allegations</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lawsuits in general claim that Juul’s marketing practices did not give the various plaintiffs sufficient information about the product to allow them to understand the harmful health effects using the company’s products, specifically e-cigarettes, would cause. Other defendants commonly listed in the lawsuits include Pax Labs, Inc. and Ploom, Inc., other Juul entities, and Altria which purportedly helped Juul expand and become the dominant company selling e-cigarettes when it <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/juul-and-altria-face-class-action-antitrust-lawsuit/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">invested in Juul</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/California_Northern_District_Court/3--19-md-02913/In_Re--_Juul_Labs_Inc._Marketing_Sales_Practices_and_Products_Liability_Litigation/677/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Complaints against Juul</a> include allegations that the company was attempting to maximize its profits by creating an addictive nicotine delivery device, and that it was meant to create and sustain addiction.&nbsp; In addition, the company is accused of targeting a youth market and “creating a youth e-cigarette epidemic and public health crisis.” The complaints purport that Juul misled consumers in its marketing to believe that its e-cigarettes contained less nicotine than they actually do, and delayed complying with regulations for its products, in order to increase sales.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The many plaintiffs are seeking damages for injuries from the use of Juul products, including for pain and suffering, all medical bills, and mental and emotional impacts or loss of enjoyment of life. Lawsuits filed by those related to another who used Juul products, purportedly causing the individual’s death or serious health impacts, ask for damages to compensate for their losses and mental and emotional impacts as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juul argues against many of these complaints, claiming that the <a href=\"https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/California_Northern_District_Court/3--19-md-02913/In_Re--_Juul_Labs_Inc._Marketing_Sales_Practices_and_Products_Liability_Litigation/1171/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">proper discovery was not submitted</a> or that <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/agriculture/five-similar-responses-to-motions-to-dismiss-individual-plaintiffs-tort-claims-filed-in-juul-marketing-case/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">a Plaintiff Fact Sheet was not submitted</a> within the required time frame.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Filing Patterns</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, lawsuits against the company are filed in general more frequently than the high average of 3.6 lawsuits a day. Docket Alarm data reports an average of 5.4 lawsuits filed with Juul listed as a party during the last three months. Of course, the day-to-day number of suits varies; on Friday, December 4 about 12 lawsuits were filed against the company, but on the previous day there were only two. The lawsuits against Juul typically trickle in by days or weeks, but some days they come in droves. On November 30, at least 36 lawsuits were filed against the company. The two months where Juul was involved in over 250 new lawsuits were August of this year and October of last year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Xgr5o5R654-By39yvI8zfp7qp8IK_bhGtiXIcn1C2rEBt_RmiM8JkmmTV44up97oyDIlvsHJCF2JXUD9FuL5OxZP_gKbqizdsoaTCz7huP0JBONLmK4Qt6ihRHKGyNoAGFalEYaQ\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In mid-April, the company received over a hundred lawsuits in a few days. Some of the new lawsuits cited studies arguing that the use of e-cigarettes could make contracting COVID-19 more dangerous. <a href=\"https://www.beasleyallen.com/news/juul-lawsuits-allege-links-between-vaping-and-coronavirus-complications/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Beasley Allen</a>, which represented some of the plaintiffs who filed on the highest day, cited that an amended complaint in the case said “JUUL users are also at greater risk of suffering more serious complications if they contract the coronavirus” and asked for the company to pay for medical monitoring related to COVID-19. Outside of this short-lived rise in cases, there has not been a significant change in litigation against Juul due to the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Consolidated Case</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of analysis, 1,523 of the cases against Juul are being heard in the Northern District of California. Some of these have been consolidated into <a href=\"https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/California_Northern_District_Court/3--19-md-02913/In_Re--_Juul_Labs_Inc._Marketing_Sales_Practices_and_Products_Liability_Litigation/#q=2913\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">In Re: Juul Labs, Inc. Marketing, Sales Practices, and Products Liability Litigation</a>. According to Docket Alarm, the rate of filing against Juul for the last three months in this court is higher than normal, at 4.5 filings per day.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6Gb4C1lu6d8jEMRitum5fLkCQDI3PRYjFu9sZ8pFVWtAn_Ajsd8WZ289g-2-RiKxDD1ZupA0ekWs3SIBVv5Tubyi8RFxPxYL4o7g9KrNrVavhh7E3AqQZw6GZR80lOiR-0ol6vIL\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The complaints in this case are filed by a variety of plaintiffs. Broad groups include individuals who claim they have been harmed because of Juul’s practices, relatives of individuals who have died purportedly from the effects of using Juul’s products, school districts, various jurisdictions, and others who feel they have lost health or spent money based on the practices of Juul. Lawsuits from school districts and schools claim that Juul contributed in causing youth to become addicted to its e-cigarettes, leading to preventative and educational expenses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the initial complaints are very similar and use the same form; for example, <a href=\"https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/California_Northern_District_Court/3--20-cv-08348/Trent_et_al_v._JUUL_Labs_Inc._d-b-a_as_PAX_LABS_INC._and_PLOOM_INC._et_al/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">one lawsuit filed in late November </a>in the Northern District of California by Tara and Harvey Trent contained <a href=\"https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/California_Northern_District_Court/3--20-cv-08348/Trent_et_al_v._JUUL_Labs_Inc._d-b-a_as_PAX_LABS_INC._and_PLOOM_INC._et_al/1/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">a short form complaint</a> referencing the 290-page <a href=\"https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/California_Northern_District_Court/3--19-md-02913/In_Re--_Juul_Labs_Inc._Marketing_Sales_Practices_and_Products_Liability_Litigation/677/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">consolidated master complaint for personal injury allegations</a> within the larger Juul Labs marketing lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plaintiffs in this suit selected to file their suit against the main defendants on the form, including Juul; Altria Group, Inc.;&nbsp; Philip Morris USA, Inc.; Altria Client Services LLC; Altria Group Distribution Company; and Altria Enterprises LLC.; known as the management defendants. The manufacturing defendants included Mother Murphy’s Labs, Inc.; Alternative Ingredients, Inc.; Tobacco Technology, Inc.; and eLiquitech, Inc.. but not the distributors or retailers, which includes gas station companies and Walmart. The short form complaint was <a href=\"https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/California_Northern_District_Court/3--19-md-02913/In_Re--_Juul_Labs_Inc._Marketing_Sales_Practices_and_Products_Liability_Litigation/1163/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">modified in November</a> from the previous complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The short-form complaint lists a wide variety of symptoms that plaintiffs have claimed were the cause of their injury in multiple categories including addiction, mental health, cognitive, cardiovascular, neurologic, and respiratory. It lists certain health effects in each category and allows for individuals to specify other health effects outside of what is listed. Plaintiffs filing a short complaint can make claims under 19 different causes, including design and manufacturing defects, failure to warn, negligence in representation, fraud, conspiracy, breach of warranty, unjust enrichment, wrongful death, survival action, and loss of consortium.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The co-lead counsel, those who filed the consolidated master complaint for the plaintiffs in June 2020, include <a href=\"https://www.lieffcabraser.com/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Lieff Cabraser Heimann &amp; Bernstein</a>, <a href=\"https://www.girardsharp.com/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Girard Sharp LLP</a>, and <a href=\"http://kellerrohrback.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Keller Rohrback LLP</a>; however, individual plaintiffs have a wide variety of firms representing them in addition to these firms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Juul’s Representation</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/I0XI69IylgM7IfQNBvvPgjJuzJ5ko_71uPELRz2SimeoGsIZTfwOkP6kJKR7bOcuSIS5dkQrIWqWYXU3YboAczEMf-gg2yb1OdYbGkZpUUnu57dZm5oYYto09402hAJomLagU-gn\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gibsondunn.com/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher</a> represents Juul in many of its product liability suits, the company represented Juul as the suits were beginning to be filed on a large scale in 2018 and 2019, and has continued to represent them. <a href=\"https://www.kirkland.com/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Kirkland &amp; Ellis</a> has also defended Juul in many of its suits. The company is represented in that case by these two firms as well as <a href=\"https://www.paulweiss.com/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton &amp; Garrison</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dowdbennett.com/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Dowd Bennett,</a> <a href=\"https://www.elliottgreenleaf.com/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Elliott Greenleaf</a>, <a href=\"https://www.foley.com/en\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Foley &amp; Lardner</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dechert.com/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Dechert</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mto.com/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mcguirewoods.com/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">McGuireWoods</a>, <a href=\"https://www.squirepattonboggs.com/en\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Squire Patton Boggs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.jacksonkelly.com/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Jackson Kelly</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.lightfootlaw.com/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Lightfoot Franklin &amp; White</a>.&nbsp; (Many of the product liability suits go directly into the consolidated case and are not treated by the Docket Alarm analytics as a  separate suit.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.quinnemanuel.com/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan</a> represents Juul in 46 cases, a similar number in comparison to Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, however, it primarily represents Juul as a plaintiff. These suits were also filed primarily in the last year. Juul is a plaintiff in 85 suits filed in the last few years, most of which are patent suits. The company has claimed that the system it developed for e-cigarettes and its marks which have become well known are being used by other companies in order to sell more products.&nbsp; In a <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/agriculture/juul-claims-competitors-are-getting-a-free-ride-by-using-its-trademarks/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">suit filed on November 30</a>, the company claimed that its products are “targets” for many companies hoping to use its efforts and investments to make more profits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/FV2aFEs_W6NhBEj7pybrXas0HrAJ2C-04QNk-ZXOgJ_GJGnoALaM59xeHJdqLVkjpX5sHCKO_il0dK2rJQ0wjYBDxssMcnakjpkvHy-pziljkXxHm3QB-zz-PbWBkE_nAIZ1XhlD\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Moving Forward</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A majority of these suits are still being filed, and Juul is consistently filing motions to dismiss the claims against it, however, it is still unclear how the cases will end. Juul has, according to a <a href=\"https://www.juullabs.com/juul-labs-continues-its-reset-and-long-term-methodical-approach/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">press release from September</a>, committed to “reset,” to earn the trust of stakeholders and combat underage-use of its products. The company said that through a long-term approach it plans to “end the era of the combustible cigarette” by providing better alternatives, such as its e-cigarette. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The analytics in this article are powered by One-Click&nbsp;Analytics from Docket Alarm.&nbsp;To learn more,&nbsp;</em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://go.fastcase.com/e/427522/on-for-attorneys-month-2020-10/6q5xf8/996840853?h=6T08p-iYECq2ypd8eExfm-jBDAmlxsMZ1A5kEUAX71c\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><em>schedule a demo&nbsp;</em></a><em>with the Docket Alarm team.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/agriculture/analytics-juuls-response-to-thousands-of-lawsuits/\">ANALYTICS: Juul&#8217;s Response to Thousands of Lawsuits</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com\">LawStreetMedia</a>.</p>",

  "description": "<p>While the COVID-19 pandemic may have affected many aspects of society, patent litigation has not been negatively impacted. Docket Alarm analytics show that the volume of patent litigation has increased slightly, despite the economic downturn. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patent litigation has increased dramatically since 2000; while recent years do not match the heights of earlier in the decade, litigation remains much higher than 2005 levels. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://manage.lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6899\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image.png 624w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-300x81.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies designed to make money from patent litigation may be a part of that increase. Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs), according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), are “firm[s] that primarily acquire[] patents and seek[] to generate revenue by asserting them against accused infringers.” In 2013, the FTC initiated a <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/policy/studies/patent-assertion-entities-pae-study\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> on PAEs, which was released in 2016; as a result of the study, the agency recommended patent litigation reforms. The study said PAEs can be divided into two categories: Portfolio PAEs and Litigation PAEs. Portfolio PAEs have vast capital to purchase patents, creating a broad patent license portfolio. Meanwhile, Litigation PAEs are more common and typically rely on revenue sharing agreements to acquire patents and are frequent litigation filers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of the reasons for the increase, patent litigation&#8217;s dramatic increase in recent years is notable, and large technology companies are sued frequently. The following analysis, powered by <a href=\"https://go.fastcase.com/l/427522/2020-10-09/6pvdgz\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Docket Alarm&#8217;s Analytics Workbench</a>, will focus on the most active plaintiffs in District Court cases marked with a patent “nature of suit” code since the beginning of 2019. A follow-up article will explore a similar analysis in the Patent Trial and Appeal Board.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Courts</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://manage.lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6900\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-1.png 526w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-1-300x130.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From January 1, 2019 to October 31, 2020, among district courts, patent suits were most often filed in the District of Delaware, the Western District of Texas, the Eastern District of Texas, the Northern District of California, and the Central District of California. Both the Eastern and Western Districts of Texas have a <a href=\"https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2019/02/18/newest-patent-rocket-docket-waco-texas/id=106453/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">reputation</a> for patent litigation. &nbsp;After the Supreme Court unanimously <a href=\"https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/Supreme_Court/16-341/TC_Heartland_LLC_Petitioner_v._Kraft_Foods_Group_Brands_LLC/05-22-2017-Judgment_REVERSED_and_case_REMANDED/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">ruled</a> in 2017 that a defendant should only face a patent lawsuit in the state where it is incorporated, the quantity of patent litigation in the District of Delaware, where many U.S. companies are incorporated, became the next logical recipient of suits. Similarly, there was a predictable uptick in the number of lawsuits in California because of the number of tech giants in Silicon Valley. In that Supreme Court case, many technology companies filed <a href=\"https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/Supreme_Court/16-341/TC_Heartland_LLC_Petitioner_v._Kraft_Foods_Group_Brands_LLC/02-06-2017-Brief_amici_curiae_of_48_Internet/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">amicus briefs</a>, noting that PAEs often pick venues where they are likely to get a favorable judgment and the defendants will often settle to avoid costs and lengthy litigation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top Five Patent\nPlaintiffs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Docket Alarm data, beginning in 2019, the most\nfrequent patent plaintiffs are WSOU Investments, Symbology Innovations, Uniloc\n2017, Cedar Lane Technologies, and Neodron. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WSOU Investments </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://manage.lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6901\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2.png 406w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2-300x175.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 406px) 100vw, 406px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://manage.lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6903\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-4.png 563w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-4-300x110.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://manage.lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6904\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-5.png 466w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-5-300x168.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://manage.lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6905\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-6.png 466w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-6-300x41.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.docketalarm.com/analytics/workbench/4646140403941376/most-litigious-paes---district-court#q=&amp;v=party_profile&amp;f=party-Wsou&amp;viewargs=party-Wsou\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">WSOU Investments</a> averages approximately five new case filings per week.

Moreover, patents and other intellectual property have been viewed as “recession proof” assets because these items can be protected even if the economy takes a turn for the worse. This may be part of why there have been 37% more patent-related litigation in the past three months and 431 patent-related district court filings in March 2020 alone, when the COVID-19 pandemic set in.

    "#": "<p>While the COVID-19 pandemic may have affected many aspects of society, patent litigation has not been negatively impacted. Docket Alarm analytics show that the volume of patent litigation has increased slightly, despite the economic downturn. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patent litigation has increased dramatically since 2000; while recent years do not match the heights of earlier in the decade, litigation remains much higher than 2005 levels. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://manage.lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6899\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image.png 624w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-300x81.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies designed to make money from patent litigation may be a part of that increase. Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs), according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), are “firm[s] that primarily acquire[] patents and seek[] to generate revenue by asserting them against accused infringers.” In 2013, the FTC initiated a <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/policy/studies/patent-assertion-entities-pae-study\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> on PAEs, which was released in 2016; as a result of the study, the agency recommended patent litigation reforms. The study said PAEs can be divided into two categories: Portfolio PAEs and Litigation PAEs. Portfolio PAEs have vast capital to purchase patents, creating a broad patent license portfolio. Meanwhile, Litigation PAEs are more common and typically rely on revenue sharing agreements to acquire patents and are frequent litigation filers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of the reasons for the increase, patent litigation&#8217;s dramatic increase in recent years is notable, and large technology companies are sued frequently. The following analysis, powered by <a href=\"https://go.fastcase.com/l/427522/2020-10-09/6pvdgz\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Docket Alarm&#8217;s Analytics Workbench</a>, will focus on the most active plaintiffs in District Court cases marked with a patent “nature of suit” code since the beginning of 2019. A follow-up article will explore a similar analysis in the Patent Trial and Appeal Board.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Courts</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://manage.lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6900\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-1.png 526w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-1-300x130.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From January 1, 2019 to October 31, 2020, among district courts, patent suits were most often filed in the District of Delaware, the Western District of Texas, the Eastern District of Texas, the Northern District of California, and the Central District of California. Both the Eastern and Western Districts of Texas have a <a href=\"https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2019/02/18/newest-patent-rocket-docket-waco-texas/id=106453/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">reputation</a> for patent litigation. &nbsp;After the Supreme Court unanimously <a href=\"https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/Supreme_Court/16-341/TC_Heartland_LLC_Petitioner_v._Kraft_Foods_Group_Brands_LLC/05-22-2017-Judgment_REVERSED_and_case_REMANDED/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">ruled</a> in 2017 that a defendant should only face a patent lawsuit in the state where it is incorporated, the quantity of patent litigation in the District of Delaware, where many U.S. companies are incorporated, became the next logical recipient of suits. Similarly, there was a predictable uptick in the number of lawsuits in California because of the number of tech giants in Silicon Valley. In that Supreme Court case, many technology companies filed <a href=\"https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/Supreme_Court/16-341/TC_Heartland_LLC_Petitioner_v._Kraft_Foods_Group_Brands_LLC/02-06-2017-Brief_amici_curiae_of_48_Internet/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">amicus briefs</a>, noting that PAEs often pick venues where they are likely to get a favorable judgment and the defendants will often settle to avoid costs and lengthy litigation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top Five Patent\nPlaintiffs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Docket Alarm data, beginning in 2019, the most\nfrequent patent plaintiffs are WSOU Investments, Symbology Innovations, Uniloc\n2017, Cedar Lane Technologies, and Neodron. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WSOU Investments </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://manage.lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6901\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2.png 406w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2-300x175.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 406px) 100vw, 406px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://manage.lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6903\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-4.png 563w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-4-300x110.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://manage.lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6904\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-5.png 466w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-5-300x168.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://manage.lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6905\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-6.png 466w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-6-300x41.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.docketalarm.com/analytics/workbench/4646140403941376/most-litigious-paes---district-court#q=&amp;v=party_profile&amp;f=party-Wsou&amp;viewargs=party-Wsou\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">WSOU Investments</a> averages approximately five new case filings per week.

Moreover, patents and other intellectual property have been viewed as “recession proof” assets because these items can be protected even if the economy takes a turn for the worse. This may be part of why there have been 37% more patent-related litigation in the past three months and 431 patent-related district court filings in March 2020 alone, when the COVID-19 pandemic set in. As the pandemic goes on, 2021 could see a further increase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The analytics in this article are powered by One-Click&nbsp;Analytics from Docket Alarm.&nbsp;To learn more,&nbsp;</em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://go.fastcase.com/e/427522/on-for-attorneys-month-2020-10/6q5xf8/996840853?h=6T08p-iYECq2ypd8eExfm-jBDAmlxsMZ1A5kEUAX71c\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><em>schedule a demo&nbsp;</em></a><em>with the Docket Alarm team.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/analytics-the-most-litigious-district-court-patent-plaintiffs/\">ANALYTICS: The Most Litigious District Court Patent Plaintiffs</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com\">LawStreetMedia</a>.</p>"

  "title": "ANALYTICS: How the Meat Industry Leads to Dozens of Antitrust Lawsuits",
  "description": "<p>Antitrust lawsuits are frequently filed against companies in the meat industries, specifically against companies who process and pack the meat. While many farms and companies raise the animals for meat, few companies process the meat and distribute it to stores and restaurants. According to <a href=\"http://www.themarketworks.org/stats#:~:text=Annual%20sales%20total%20%24152.5%20billion,to%20nations%20around%20the%20world.\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">the North American Meat Institute</a>, the meat industry employs over 500,000 people in the United States who feed and care for animals, process the meat, and handle transportation. The average American reportedly spends 1.3 percent of their “disposable personal income” on meat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to an analysis conducted using <a href=\"https://go.fastcase.com/l/427522/2020-10-09/6pvdgz\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Docket Alarm’s analytics tools</a>, federal antitrust lawsuits have been filed consistently against some of the nation&#8217;s largest meat processors, defined here to include Tyson Foods, Pilgrim&#8217;s Pride, Wayne Farms, JBS, Cargill, Sanderson Farms, Hormel Foods, Smithfield Foods, and industry data aggregator Agri-Stats. Nearly every month since January 2019 one or two antitrust lawsuits have been filed against the companies, with an average of just under one a week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The filings against the nine companies for anticompetitive activity typically rise in the summer months. At least 88 cases have been filed in federal courts against the companies since the beginning of January 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/apn8oqoPgbcImIi84ogFom25ZBjJOgWCTigb6Hv0AyeBqREApBMARytDXkoZGfU-2gDjhZSM7kREUCa4nnD8GGJ4pW6X8CPLClI3iQE3KoyUCnocgKnsegv32gAqPoQ1KMk7rr3F\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8GViA8bY0zyYo0zN27IUPsmnXHIxVp2FBdoaz8eQ3JMdlGwSXwXBnBx-6xVOht6whq58_JqlB4DGeOpmNn-2ZiEWCLNG87ixJDAKi7fFIlg2j7yzlgwkuD5B3NIjy9OJM2J2YPcQ\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the United States, meatpacking companies process “33.6 million head of cattle, 587,000 calves, 129.9 million hogs and 2.23 million sheep and lambs into more than 55 billion pounds of beef, pork, lamb and veal,” according to the Institute. Poultry processors yearly take in 9.34 billion chickens creating almost 50 billion pounds of meat. The institute reported a sales total of $152.5 billion in meat and $65.6 billion in poultry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The industry has long encountered allegations of anticompetitve activity, due to the small number of companies participating. A 1981 article in <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3114129?seq=1\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">The Business History Review</a> by two economics professors at Loyola University of Chicago discussed a consent decree in a beef antitrust case in 1920 which was later overturned in 1954. <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/atr/speech/antitrust-enforcement-meat-packing-industry\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">In a 1996 address</a>, then-Assistant Attorney General Anne K. Bingaman said about the meatpacking industry, “concentration in this industry has increased significantly over the last 15 years, and we have been monitoring this industry on an ongoing basis since before I arrived.” She said the Department of Justice had made several investigations into the industry in the last few years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic began, meatpacking plants started to receive <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/agriculture/meatpacking-companies-accused-of-putting-minorities-at-risk-during-pandemic/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">criticism</a> for keeping plants open. According to <a href=\"https://foodtruckempire.com/news/meat-packing-industry-statistics/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">the Food Truck Empire</a>, the industry accounts for about 5.6 percent of the United States GDP and the pandemic brought more attention to how much consumers rely on the industry to provide protein.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the antitrust lawsuits against players in the meatpacking industry are filed around the United States, most of the lawsuits, especially those concerning broiler chickens, have been moved into the Northern District of Illinois where Judge Thomas Durkin has been assigned as the judge in over 20 antitrust lawsuits in the last two years and oversees at least one large consolidated case about broiler chicken antitrust. Judge John Tunheim with the Minnesota District Court is also overseeing many antitrust meat lawsuits, he has heard about 10 of the cases. Other judges were assigned three or fewer antitrust suits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a deep dive into Docket Alarm’s available analytics on five of the top meat processing companies who have been served with antitrust lawsuits since 2019.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyson Foods</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/k38P12BvDXjTAA8mq7dSgn0X6ZRIBZtXwNqvEDkobxZ-G6SW2H1iW2odFYfNrEgjuuwwl18NUL2kJvD_ZJvQZVn3EjH_h7nHHVnBP3Srums0rZZWPeCRmTe32PQBeXFH-DhNJBeX\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyson Foods has been the defendant named most frequently, and was sued in at least 60 of the 88 cases. One reason they are involved in the most lawsuits could be the company’s reach into multiple industries with meat plants designed and used to process various animals, particularly chicken and beef, the two animals seen most frequently in recent antitrust lawsuits. In the last two years, the company has been sued an average of 2.7 times each month.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Yjc1MAXcpDs1ajir-3dw0cO8Rkrba8eKeKoMPsh34C9Gh1iAgJTvB82Z_gLYXSxP_Ia8lzXDxW9FzYZ6t932mGV3dt4A0x-3eXQf50DnLPTIXL_0mSC3hd2vJLK7uL4QrB8Ydz_g\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Docket Alarm data, Tyson retained Dykema Gossett, Perkins Coie, Axinn Veltrop &amp; Harkrider for its cases.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pilgrim’s Pride</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are currently more antitrust lawsuits being filed in the chicken industry than other meat industries.  Especially frequent are suits related to broiler chickens, which are bred specifically for meat rather than eggs. Pilgrim’s Pride has been labeled a defendant in at least 44 antitrust lawsuits in recent years. The company is one of the largest chicken producers in the United States, and is owned by JBS, a major beef and pork processor which has also been involved in many of its own antitrust lawsuits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/S6JKHu2ri4_PDMYK3p4rScnTHav_OpYKJkNkdA7SEOviOq9L7AdmtirIxZ-wddbm8thhuSRe0EDy14SoNDlHGNMY0SvPr4K8qm3xkr7MLaFkgRSDhz7sPu77w4BGsM0xbKR3hH_j\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The company has received lawsuits from <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/agriculture/pilgrims-pride-investors-file-lawsuit-after-federal-antitrust-case/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">investors</a>,<a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/agriculture/chicken-companies-receive-antitrust-lawsuits-from-restaurant-groups/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"> restaurants</a>, and others in the chicken industry including “growers,” who contract with processing companies to raise chickens for them. Lawsuits against this group rose recently, with six lawsuits filed in September against groups of chicken processing companies, more than any single month in the previous two years. Most of these lawsuits are filed or transferred into the Illinois Northern District, where 33 of these cases are located, 19 of which are being heard by Judge Durkin. The following graph shows the number of cases filed in the Northern District Illinois Court compared with the number where Pilgrim’s Pride is listed as a defendant.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5r5RmzEoGk9yA8nMwF31HBk4wLVwFVDuuZkVNxPuuY-WzUIh1XAlVvgo-b5xkcku2X98n8kIxFs_rP7Hxq1ufUmtBWS0ZKKwj4imkV0GCfLbSmY3J2Zb0qWb0yYG_d_fdBdC-774\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pilgrim’s Pride’s representation has varied each year, with Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges being the only firm to represent the company in 2019 and 2020. Outside of that firm, Adsuar Muniz Goyco Seda &amp; Perez Ochoa PSC represented the company in two cases in 2019, Whiteford Taylor and Preston represented them in 2019, and three firms, Kasowitz Benson Torres, Lewis Roca Rothgerber Christie Lip, and Richilano Shea each represented Pilgrim&#8217;s Pride for one lawsuit in 2020.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cargill</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cargill has been sued 14 times as Cargill and 12 times as Cargill Meat, although most, if not all, of the filings against Cargill Meat included both parties.

    "#": "<p>Antitrust lawsuits are frequently filed against companies in the meat industries, specifically against companies who process and pack the meat. While many farms and companies raise the animals for meat, few companies process the meat and distribute it to stores and restaurants. According to <a href=\"http://www.themarketworks.org/stats#:~:text=Annual%20sales%20total%20%24152.5%20billion,to%20nations%20around%20the%20world.\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">the North American Meat Institute</a>, the meat industry employs over 500,000 people in the United States who feed and care for animals, process the meat, and handle transportation. The average American reportedly spends 1.3 percent of their “disposable personal income” on meat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to an analysis conducted using <a href=\"https://go.fastcase.com/l/427522/2020-10-09/6pvdgz\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Docket Alarm’s analytics tools</a>, federal antitrust lawsuits have been filed consistently against some of the nation&#8217;s largest meat processors, defined here to include Tyson Foods, Pilgrim&#8217;s Pride, Wayne Farms, JBS, Cargill, Sanderson Farms, Hormel Foods, Smithfield Foods, and industry data aggregator Agri-Stats. Nearly every month since January 2019 one or two antitrust lawsuits have been filed against the companies, with an average of just under one a week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The filings against the nine companies for anticompetitive activity typically rise in the summer months. At least 88 cases have been filed in federal courts against the companies since the beginning of January 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/apn8oqoPgbcImIi84ogFom25ZBjJOgWCTigb6Hv0AyeBqREApBMARytDXkoZGfU-2gDjhZSM7kREUCa4nnD8GGJ4pW6X8CPLClI3iQE3KoyUCnocgKnsegv32gAqPoQ1KMk7rr3F\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8GViA8bY0zyYo0zN27IUPsmnXHIxVp2FBdoaz8eQ3JMdlGwSXwXBnBx-6xVOht6whq58_JqlB4DGeOpmNn-2ZiEWCLNG87ixJDAKi7fFIlg2j7yzlgwkuD5B3NIjy9OJM2J2YPcQ\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the United States, meatpacking companies process “33.6 million head of cattle, 587,000 calves, 129.9 million hogs and 2.23 million sheep and lambs into more than 55 billion pounds of beef, pork, lamb and veal,” according to the Institute. Poultry processors yearly take in 9.34 billion chickens creating almost 50 billion pounds of meat. The institute reported a sales total of $152.5 billion in meat and $65.6 billion in poultry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The industry has long encountered allegations of anticompetitve activity, due to the small number of companies participating. A 1981 article in <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3114129?seq=1\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">The Business History Review</a> by two economics professors at Loyola University of Chicago discussed a consent decree in a beef antitrust case in 1920 which was later overturned in 1954. <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/atr/speech/antitrust-enforcement-meat-packing-industry\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">In a 1996 address</a>, then-Assistant Attorney General Anne K. Bingaman said about the meatpacking industry, “concentration in this industry has increased significantly over the last 15 years, and we have been monitoring this industry on an ongoing basis since before I arrived.” She said the Department of Justice had made several investigations into the industry in the last few years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic began, meatpacking plants started to receive <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/agriculture/meatpacking-companies-accused-of-putting-minorities-at-risk-during-pandemic/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">criticism</a> for keeping plants open. According to <a href=\"https://foodtruckempire.com/news/meat-packing-industry-statistics/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">the Food Truck Empire</a>, the industry accounts for about 5.6 percent of the United States GDP and the pandemic brought more attention to how much consumers rely on the industry to provide protein.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the antitrust lawsuits against players in the meatpacking industry are filed around the United States, most of the lawsuits, especially those concerning broiler chickens, have been moved into the Northern District of Illinois where Judge Thomas Durkin has been assigned as the judge in over 20 antitrust lawsuits in the last two years and oversees at least one large consolidated case about broiler chicken antitrust. Judge John Tunheim with the Minnesota District Court is also overseeing many antitrust meat lawsuits, he has heard about 10 of the cases. Other judges were assigned three or fewer antitrust suits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a deep dive into Docket Alarm’s available analytics on five of the top meat processing companies who have been served with antitrust lawsuits since 2019.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyson Foods</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/k38P12BvDXjTAA8mq7dSgn0X6ZRIBZtXwNqvEDkobxZ-G6SW2H1iW2odFYfNrEgjuuwwl18NUL2kJvD_ZJvQZVn3EjH_h7nHHVnBP3Srums0rZZWPeCRmTe32PQBeXFH-DhNJBeX\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyson Foods has been the defendant named most frequently, and was sued in at least 60 of the 88 cases. One reason they are involved in the most lawsuits could be the company’s reach into multiple industries with meat plants designed and used to process various animals, particularly chicken and beef, the two animals seen most frequently in recent antitrust lawsuits. In the last two years, the company has been sued an average of 2.7 times each month.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Yjc1MAXcpDs1ajir-3dw0cO8Rkrba8eKeKoMPsh34C9Gh1iAgJTvB82Z_gLYXSxP_Ia8lzXDxW9FzYZ6t932mGV3dt4A0x-3eXQf50DnLPTIXL_0mSC3hd2vJLK7uL4QrB8Ydz_g\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Docket Alarm data, Tyson retained Dykema Gossett, Perkins Coie, Axinn Veltrop &amp; Harkrider for its cases.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pilgrim’s Pride</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are currently more antitrust lawsuits being filed in the chicken industry than other meat industries.  Especially frequent are suits related to broiler chickens, which are bred specifically for meat rather than eggs. Pilgrim’s Pride has been labeled a defendant in at least 44 antitrust lawsuits in recent years. The company is one of the largest chicken producers in the United States, and is owned by JBS, a major beef and pork processor which has also been involved in many of its own antitrust lawsuits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/S6JKHu2ri4_PDMYK3p4rScnTHav_OpYKJkNkdA7SEOviOq9L7AdmtirIxZ-wddbm8thhuSRe0EDy14SoNDlHGNMY0SvPr4K8qm3xkr7MLaFkgRSDhz7sPu77w4BGsM0xbKR3hH_j\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The company has received lawsuits from <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/agriculture/pilgrims-pride-investors-file-lawsuit-after-federal-antitrust-case/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">investors</a>,<a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/agriculture/chicken-companies-receive-antitrust-lawsuits-from-restaurant-groups/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"> restaurants</a>, and others in the chicken industry including “growers,” who contract with processing companies to raise chickens for them. Lawsuits against this group rose recently, with six lawsuits filed in September against groups of chicken processing companies, more than any single month in the previous two years. Most of these lawsuits are filed or transferred into the Illinois Northern District, where 33 of these cases are located, 19 of which are being heard by Judge Durkin. The following graph shows the number of cases filed in the Northern District Illinois Court compared with the number where Pilgrim’s Pride is listed as a defendant.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5r5RmzEoGk9yA8nMwF31HBk4wLVwFVDuuZkVNxPuuY-WzUIh1XAlVvgo-b5xkcku2X98n8kIxFs_rP7Hxq1ufUmtBWS0ZKKwj4imkV0GCfLbSmY3J2Zb0qWb0yYG_d_fdBdC-774\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pilgrim’s Pride’s representation has varied each year, with Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges being the only firm to represent the company in 2019 and 2020. Outside of that firm, Adsuar Muniz Goyco Seda &amp; Perez Ochoa PSC represented the company in two cases in 2019, Whiteford Taylor and Preston represented them in 2019, and three firms, Kasowitz Benson Torres, Lewis Roca Rothgerber Christie Lip, and Richilano Shea each represented Pilgrim&#8217;s Pride for one lawsuit in 2020.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cargill</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cargill has been sued 14 times as Cargill and 12 times as Cargill Meat, although most, if not all, of the filings against Cargill Meat included both parties. Cargill is primarily involved in antitrust lawsuits related to beef, but it also produces turkey, chicken, and egg products <a href=\"https://www.cargill.com/meat-poultry/protein-north-america#:~:text=Cargill%20Protein%20%2D%20North%20America%20produces,by%2Dproducts%20around%20the%20world.\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">according to its website</a>.

  "description": "<p>Facebook has been in the news frequently in the last few years, ranging from allegations that the platform does not do enough to protect its users to being accused of <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/facebook-privacy-suit-returns-to-trial/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">biometrics violations</a>, to CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s recent Congressional <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/tech-ceos-face-congressional-hearing-over-anticompetitive-behavior/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">testimony</a> regarding the tech giant’s allegedly anticompetitive behavior.

Predictably, the suits range from intellectual property, contract, personal injury, civil rights, antitrust, and other statutory actions. The types of suits range from traditional business litigation to the emerging <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/class-action-suit-filed-against-facebook-for-bipa-violations/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">privacy</a> and <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/facebooks-reply-to-motion-to-dismiss-in-antitrust-case/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">antitrust</a> litigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://go.fastcase.com/l/427522/2020-10-09/6pvdgz\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6067\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights4.png 373w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights4-215x300.png 215w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights4-301x420.png 301w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 373px) 100vw, 373px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In all of Facebook’s federal civil suits found on Docket Alarm, <a href=\"https://www.docketalarm.com/analytics/workbench/5435208873705472/facebook-representation-over-time#v=overview&amp;q=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> has been a defendant 85 percent of the time, in 141 suits out of 178.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://go.fastcase.com/l/427522/2020-10-09/6pvdgz\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6068\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights5.png 996w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights5-300x146.png 300w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights5-768x375.png 768w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights5-533x261.png 533w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights5-696x340.png 696w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights5-861x420.png 861w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://go.fastcase.com/l/427522/2020-10-09/6pvdgz\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6069\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights6.png 1002w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights6-300x127.png 300w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights6-768x324.png 768w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights6-696x294.png 696w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights6-995x420.png 995w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1002px) 100vw, 1002px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to an analysis of the PACER Nature of Suit case types, the largest shares belong to the &#8220;Civil Rights-Other&#8221; and &#8220;Statutory Actions-Other&#8221; categories. This is followed by personal injury, contract, patent, and trademark. Lastly, case types such as prisoner matters, copyright, assault and libel, fraud, antitrust, property, and securities are less common. This illustrates the variety of litigation that Facebook has faced since the beginning of 2019, but also shows emerging trends in 2020 as the <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/congress-raises-antitrust-concerns-over-facebooks-purchase-of-giphy/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">heightened influence</a> of <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/facebook-settles-with-record-5b-ftc-fine/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Facebook</a> is scrutinized. However, while one might expect the number of antitrust suits to be higher in light of recent Congressional scrutiny, the tech giant has only faced five antitrust suits from January 1, 2019, to September 30, 2020. Three out of the five filings were <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/reveal-chats-antitrust-case-dismissed-with-partial-leave-to-amend/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">related</a> to each other. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, from 2019 to 2020, Potter Minton has increased the number of cases where it represents Facebook, which is usually patent litigation defense. Pincus Law is another firm that has increased its business with Facebook from 2019 to 2020.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://go.fastcase.com/l/427522/2020-10-09/6pvdgz\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights7.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6070\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights7.png 1017w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights7-300x173.png 300w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights7-768x443.png 768w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights7-696x402.png 696w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights7-728x420.png 728w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1017px) 100vw, 1017px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While most of the firms represent Facebook as the defendant,\nHunton Andrews Kurth solely represents Facebook as the plaintiff. Attorney Ann\nMortimer is listed as a representative for Facebook in all of these suits, the\nmajority of which are statutory actions, such as a <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/facebook-sues-users-offering-to-extract-data-collect-likes/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">suit</a>\nfor extracting data and collecting likes and <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/facebook-takes-legal-action-against-oneaudience-for-harvesting-user-data/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">another\none</a> that harvested user data. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr solely represented Facebook as the defendant in antitrust, fraud, and civil rights suits. Most of these suits were filed towards the end of 2019 and into 2020. A large ongoing <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/reveal-chat-files-opposition-to-facebooks-motion-to-dismiss-amended-complaint/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">antitrust suit</a> that the firm has represented Facebook on was brought by Reveal Chat Co. et al., who allege that Facebook used its developer API tools to shut out the competition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Davis Wright Tremaine solely represented defendant Facebook in cases filed under “assault, libel and slander.” All of these defamation suits were brought against Facebook by the same plaintiff, who claimed that Facebook, Twitter, Apple, and Google were suppressing certain political voices after they were <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/2/18526964/facebook-ban-alex-jones-laura-loomer-milo-louis-farrakhan\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">banned</a> from social media platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://go.fastcase.com/l/427522/2020-10-09/6pvdgz\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights9.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6071\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights9.png 891w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights9-300x174.png 300w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights9-768x445.png 768w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights9-696x403.png 696w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights9-725x420.png 725w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 891px) 100vw, 891px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Covington &amp; Burling represented Facebook frequently in 2020,\nwith most of their suits being filed between March and May 2020. The\noverwhelming majority of Covington &amp; Burling’s Facebook suits are related\nto Zoom Video Communications. As Zoom exploded in popularity due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, the company faced a large influx of litigation as a result\nof its privacy and security practices, some of which <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/zoom-faces-privacy-class-action-lawsuit/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">implicated\nFacebook</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, Tucker Ellis represented Facebook in four suits; three out of the four suits were trademark-related and the last was for fraud. Furthermore, Facebook was the plaintiff in all of these suits, which were filed in the Northern District of California.  While Tucker Ellis plays a prominent role in Facebook’s 2019 litigation,  the firm has yet to represent Facebook in 2020, according to the data.  This could be an effect of the COVID-19  pandemic.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://go.fastcase.com/l/427522/2020-10-09/6pvdgz\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights10.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6072\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights10.png 900w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights10-300x173.png 300w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights10-768x442.png 768w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights10-696x401.png 696w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights10-730x420.png 730w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Facebook is the defendant in all the suits where it is represented by Keker &amp; Van Nest. These suits cover a wide range of case types, from contract and personal injury to civil rights and statutory actions. Approximately a quarter of the firm’s suits were filed within the past three months. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://go.fastcase.com/l/427522/2020-10-09/6pvdgz\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights11-1024x325.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6073\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights11-1024x325.png 1024w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights11-300x95.png 300w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights11-768x244.png 768w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights11-696x221.png 696w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights11-1068x339.png 1068w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights11-1323x420.png 1323w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights11-1320x419.png 1320w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights11.png 1373w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://go.fastcase.com/l/427522/2020-10-09/6pvdgz\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights12-1024x443.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6074\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights12-1024x443.png 1024w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights12-300x130.png 300w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights12-768x332.png 768w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights12-696x301.png 696w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights12-1068x462.png 1068w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights12-972x420.png 972w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights12.png 1106w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of Facebook’s litigation occurred in the Northern District of California, likely due to the company’s location in Silicon Valley. The judge overseeing the most Facebook cases is Judge Alan Albright, who oversaw almost double the number of suits as the remaining top 5 judges. In particular, Judge Albright mostly oversaw patent suits for Facebook in the Western District of Texas, where Facebook was often the defendant. Judge James Donato of the Northern District of California oversaw a variety of suits, including other personal injury and other statutory actions. Judge Jon Tigar, presided over mostly trademark suits in the Northern District of California. Judge William Orrick oversaw copyright, civil rights, and statutory suits in the Northern District of California, and Judge Cathy Seibel of the Southern District of New York oversaw prisoner rights, civil rights, and trademark suits. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://go.fastcase.com/l/427522/2020-10-09/6pvdgz\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights13-1024x329.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6075\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights13-1024x329.png 1024w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights13-300x96.png 300w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights13-768x247.png 768w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights13-696x224.png 696w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights13-1068x343.png 1068w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights13-1307x420.png 1307w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights13-1320x424.png 1320w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights13.png 1431w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, Facebook’s legal work has remained fairly consistent in comparison to recent years, at least when it comes to federal civil suits. For the most part, filings were consistent throughout the\ntime period. However, there were some noticeable trends. For example, in 2020, filings\ndipped in February, but spiked in March and decreased again in April, although\nnot to February’s level; these fluctuations can likely be attributed to the\npandemic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As may be expected from a tech giant at the forefront of the social media revolution, Facebook faces litigation that reflects current events. There was a large increase in civil rights suits in July 2020 in comparison to any other month; meanwhile, an increase of personal injury suits in April and May 2020 is tied to the aforementioned <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/suit-claims-facebook-linkedin-eavesdropped-on-zoom-calls/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">influx of lawsuits</a> against Zoom. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The analytics in this article are powered by One-Click&nbsp;Analytics from Docket Alarm.&nbsp;To learn more,&nbsp;</em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://go.fastcase.com/e/427522/on-for-attorneys-month-2020-10/6q5xf8/996840853?h=6T08p-iYECq2ypd8eExfm-jBDAmlxsMZ1A5kEUAX71c\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><em>schedule a demo&nbsp;</em></a><em>with the Docket Alarm team.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/insights-who-represents-facebook-a-deep-dive-powered-by-docket-alarm/\">ANALYTICS: Who Represents Facebook?

Predictably, the suits range from intellectual property, contract, personal injury, civil rights, antitrust, and other statutory actions. The types of suits range from traditional business litigation to the emerging <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/class-action-suit-filed-against-facebook-for-bipa-violations/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">privacy</a> and <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/facebooks-reply-to-motion-to-dismiss-in-antitrust-case/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">antitrust</a> litigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://go.fastcase.com/l/427522/2020-10-09/6pvdgz\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6067\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights4.png 373w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights4-215x300.png 215w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights4-301x420.png 301w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 373px) 100vw, 373px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In all of Facebook’s federal civil suits found on Docket Alarm, <a href=\"https://www.docketalarm.com/analytics/workbench/5435208873705472/facebook-representation-over-time#v=overview&amp;q=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> has been a defendant 85 percent of the time, in 141 suits out of 178.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://go.fastcase.com/l/427522/2020-10-09/6pvdgz\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6068\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights5.png 996w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights5-300x146.png 300w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights5-768x375.png 768w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights5-533x261.png 533w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights5-696x340.png 696w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights5-861x420.png 861w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://go.fastcase.com/l/427522/2020-10-09/6pvdgz\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6069\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights6.png 1002w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights6-300x127.png 300w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights6-768x324.png 768w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights6-696x294.png 696w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights6-995x420.png 995w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1002px) 100vw, 1002px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to an analysis of the PACER Nature of Suit case types, the largest shares belong to the &#8220;Civil Rights-Other&#8221; and &#8220;Statutory Actions-Other&#8221; categories. This is followed by personal injury, contract, patent, and trademark. Lastly, case types such as prisoner matters, copyright, assault and libel, fraud, antitrust, property, and securities are less common. This illustrates the variety of litigation that Facebook has faced since the beginning of 2019, but also shows emerging trends in 2020 as the <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/congress-raises-antitrust-concerns-over-facebooks-purchase-of-giphy/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">heightened influence</a> of <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/facebook-settles-with-record-5b-ftc-fine/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Facebook</a> is scrutinized. However, while one might expect the number of antitrust suits to be higher in light of recent Congressional scrutiny, the tech giant has only faced five antitrust suits from January 1, 2019, to September 30, 2020. Three out of the five filings were <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/reveal-chats-antitrust-case-dismissed-with-partial-leave-to-amend/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">related</a> to each other. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, from 2019 to 2020, Potter Minton has increased the number of cases where it represents Facebook, which is usually patent litigation defense. Pincus Law is another firm that has increased its business with Facebook from 2019 to 2020.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://go.fastcase.com/l/427522/2020-10-09/6pvdgz\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights7.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6070\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights7.png 1017w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights7-300x173.png 300w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights7-768x443.png 768w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights7-696x402.png 696w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights7-728x420.png 728w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1017px) 100vw, 1017px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While most of the firms represent Facebook as the defendant,\nHunton Andrews Kurth solely represents Facebook as the plaintiff. Attorney Ann\nMortimer is listed as a representative for Facebook in all of these suits, the\nmajority of which are statutory actions, such as a <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/facebook-sues-users-offering-to-extract-data-collect-likes/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">suit</a>\nfor extracting data and collecting likes and <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/facebook-takes-legal-action-against-oneaudience-for-harvesting-user-data/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">another\none</a> that harvested user data. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr solely represented Facebook as the defendant in antitrust, fraud, and civil rights suits. Most of these suits were filed towards the end of 2019 and into 2020. A large ongoing <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/reveal-chat-files-opposition-to-facebooks-motion-to-dismiss-amended-complaint/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">antitrust suit</a> that the firm has represented Facebook on was brought by Reveal Chat Co. et al., who allege that Facebook used its developer API tools to shut out the competition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Davis Wright Tremaine solely represented defendant Facebook in cases filed under “assault, libel and slander.” All of these defamation suits were brought against Facebook by the same plaintiff, who claimed that Facebook, Twitter, Apple, and Google were suppressing certain political voices after they were <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/2/18526964/facebook-ban-alex-jones-laura-loomer-milo-louis-farrakhan\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">banned</a> from social media platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://go.fastcase.com/l/427522/2020-10-09/6pvdgz\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights9.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6071\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights9.png 891w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights9-300x174.png 300w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights9-768x445.png 768w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights9-696x403.png 696w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights9-725x420.png 725w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 891px) 100vw, 891px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Covington &amp; Burling represented Facebook frequently in 2020,\nwith most of their suits being filed between March and May 2020. The\noverwhelming majority of Covington &amp; Burling’s Facebook suits are related\nto Zoom Video Communications. As Zoom exploded in popularity due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, the company faced a large influx of litigation as a result\nof its privacy and security practices, some of which <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/zoom-faces-privacy-class-action-lawsuit/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">implicated\nFacebook</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, Tucker Ellis represented Facebook in four suits; three out of the four suits were trademark-related and the last was for fraud. Furthermore, Facebook was the plaintiff in all of these suits, which were filed in the Northern District of California.  While Tucker Ellis plays a prominent role in Facebook’s 2019 litigation,  the firm has yet to represent Facebook in 2020, according to the data.  This could be an effect of the COVID-19  pandemic.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://go.fastcase.com/l/427522/2020-10-09/6pvdgz\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights10.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6072\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights10.png 900w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights10-300x173.png 300w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights10-768x442.png 768w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights10-696x401.png 696w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights10-730x420.png 730w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Facebook is the defendant in all the suits where it is represented by Keker &amp; Van Nest. These suits cover a wide range of case types, from contract and personal injury to civil rights and statutory actions. Approximately a quarter of the firm’s suits were filed within the past three months. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://go.fastcase.com/l/427522/2020-10-09/6pvdgz\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights11-1024x325.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6073\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights11-1024x325.png 1024w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights11-300x95.png 300w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights11-768x244.png 768w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights11-696x221.png 696w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights11-1068x339.png 1068w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights11-1323x420.png 1323w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights11-1320x419.png 1320w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights11.png 1373w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://go.fastcase.com/l/427522/2020-10-09/6pvdgz\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights12-1024x443.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6074\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights12-1024x443.png 1024w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights12-300x130.png 300w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights12-768x332.png 768w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights12-696x301.png 696w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights12-1068x462.png 1068w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights12-972x420.png 972w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Insights12.png 1106w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of Facebook’s litigation occurred in the Northern District of California, likely due to the company’s location in Silicon Valley. The judge overseeing the most Facebook cases is Judge Alan Albright, who oversaw almost double the number of suits as the remaining top 5 judges. In particular, Judge Albright mostly oversaw patent suits for Facebook in the Western District of Texas, where Facebook was often the defendant. Judge James Donato of the Northern District of California oversaw a variety of suits, including other personal injury and other statutory actions. Judge Jon Tigar, presided over mostly trademark suits in the Northern District of California.

For the most part, filings were consistent throughout the\ntime period. However, there were some noticeable trends. For example, in 2020, filings\ndipped in February, but spiked in March and decreased again in April, although\nnot to February’s level; these fluctuations can likely be attributed to the\npandemic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As may be expected from a tech giant at the forefront of the social media revolution, Facebook faces litigation that reflects current events. There was a large increase in civil rights suits in July 2020 in comparison to any other month; meanwhile, an increase of personal injury suits in April and May 2020 is tied to the aforementioned <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/suit-claims-facebook-linkedin-eavesdropped-on-zoom-calls/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">influx of lawsuits</a> against Zoom. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The analytics in this article are powered by One-Click&nbsp;Analytics from Docket Alarm.&nbsp;To learn more,&nbsp;</em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://go.fastcase.com/e/427522/on-for-attorneys-month-2020-10/6q5xf8/996840853?h=6T08p-iYECq2ypd8eExfm-jBDAmlxsMZ1A5kEUAX71c\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><em>schedule a demo&nbsp;</em></a><em>with the Docket Alarm team.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/insights-who-represents-facebook-a-deep-dive-powered-by-docket-alarm/\">ANALYTICS: Who Represents Facebook?

  "description": "<p>Law Street Media’s November 29 <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/analytics-the-most-litigious-district-court-patent-plaintiffs/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">article </a>examining patent litigation analytics focused on the district court system, just one part of a complex system of patent litigation. This article examines a similar premise; a deep dive into the companies that have had their patents challenged the most in recent years before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, using <a href=\"https://go.fastcase.com/l/427522/2020-10-09/6pvdgz\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Doc</a><a href=\"https://go.fastcase.com/l/427522/2020-10-09/6pvdgz\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><a href=\"https://go.fastcase.com/l/427522/2020-10-09/6pvdgz\">ket Alarm’s cutting-edge PTAB analytics.  </a></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As 2020 comes to a close, it is apparent that total filings at PTAB have remained steady despite the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of <em>inter partes review</em> (IPR) filings from January 1, 2019, to October 31, 2020 (the same time period as the prior article), reveals a consistent pattern. A dip in March and April 2020 was likely caused by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, but other fluctuations in the above time period are more dramatic. In fact, by May 2020 there was an uptick in filings, which could suggest a bounce back from the delays of March and April. There were 2,504 IPR petitions during this time period, which suggests overall a slight decline in comparison to a similar period from January 2017 to October 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://manage.lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-25.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7510\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-25.png 624w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-25-300x89.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Patent Owners</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://manage.lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-24.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7509\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The top five patent owners who faced the most petitions against their patents before PTAB from 2019 to October 2020 are Uniloc 2017, Rovi Guides, Neodron, Bell-Northern Research, LLC, and Masimo. There is some overlap with the <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/analytics-the-most-litigious-district-court-patent-plaintiffs/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">most litigious district court patent plaintiffs</a>; Uniloc 2017 and Neodron appear on both lists. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Uniloc 2017</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://manage.lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-21.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7506\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-21.png 624w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-21-300x175.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://manage.lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-22.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7507\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-22.png 624w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-22-300x174.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://manage.lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-23.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7508\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-23.png 624w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-23-300x76.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Uniloc 2017 has been involved <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/?s=uniloc+2017\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">in litigation</a> with Microsoft and Google; moreover, as <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/analytics-the-most-litigious-district-court-patent-plaintiffs/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">previously reported</a>, it is one of the entities associated with Fortress, who was <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/softbanks-fortress-orchestrated-anticompetitive-patent-litigation-says-intel/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">sued</a> by Intel Corporation for anticompetitive patent conduct. Uniloc 2017’s mostly cloud computing-related patents were challenged in 86 new petitions as patent owner over the last two years, an average of 0.8 new petitions per week. Of these 86 filed petitions, 14 have resulted in termination, 3 of which occurred before institution and 4 after institution. Out of the 83 institution decisions, 49 had a trial instituted, which is a 59 percent institution rate. Accordingly, Uniloc 2017 is 9 percent less likely than Docket Alarm’s average to have a petition instituted against it, whether in full or in part. It took an average of 191 days to reach the institution decision stage, slightly above the overall average of 188 days. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of the 49 trials instituted, 14 resulted in final written decisions of which 6 resulted in all claims being canceled and 8 had some claims survive; none had all claims survive. The time to reach a final written decision was quicker than the average time, 512.1 days compared to 545.1 days. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The number of petitions in 2020 was smaller than in 2019, with petitions in 2020 only for the months of January, March, and April, perhaps related to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the biggest influx of petitions occurred in January 2020, where 8 petitions were filed by Google, 2 were filed by Ericsson and 2 were filed by Samsung Electronics America. One of these Google petitions was for the <a href=\"https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/PTAB/IPR2020-00441/Inter_Partes_Review_of_U.S._Pat._8949954/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">8,949,954</a> patent, which is the patent-in-suit involved in Google’s district court suit against Uniloc 2017; <a href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/court-grants-googles-motion-to-transfer-uniloc-patent-case-out-of-texas/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Law Street Media</a> covered the motion to transfer out of the Eastern District of Texas to the Northern District of California.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rovi Guides</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://manage.lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-18.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7503\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-18.png 624w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-18-300x174.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://manage.lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-19.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7504\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-19.png 624w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-19-300x174.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://manage.lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-20.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7505\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-20.png 624w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-20-300x72.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rovi Guides is a <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1675820/000167582018000006/exhibit2101123117.htm\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">subsidiary</a> of TiVo Corporation and holds various media and media guide related patents.

Out of the 48\npetitions of which 1 is pending, 30 percent of petitions were instituted in\npart or in full for an average of 20.6 claims that took an average of 181.4\ndays to reach the institution stage.

The number of <em>inter partes review</em> (IPR) filings from January 1, 2019, to October 31, 2020 (the same time period as the prior article), reveals a consistent pattern. A dip in March and April 2020 was likely caused by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, but other fluctuations in the above time period are more dramatic. In fact, by May 2020 there was an uptick in filings, which could suggest a bounce back from the delays of March and April. There were 2,504 IPR petitions during this time period, which suggests overall a slight decline in comparison to a similar period from January 2017 to October 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://manage.lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-25.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7510\" srcset=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-25.png 624w, https://lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-25-300x89.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Patent Owners</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://manage.lawstreetmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-24.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7509\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The top five patent owners who faced the most petitions against their patents before PTAB from 2019 to October 2020 are Uniloc 2017, Rovi Guides, Neodron, Bell-Northern Research, LLC, and Masimo.

Uniloc 2017’s mostly cloud computing-related patents were challenged in 86 new petitions as patent owner over the last two years, an average of 0.8 new petitions per week. Of these 86 filed petitions, 14 have resulted in termination, 3 of which occurred before institution and 4 after institution. Out of the 83 institution decisions, 49 had a trial instituted, which is a 59 percent institution rate. Accordingly, Uniloc 2017 is 9 percent less likely than Docket Alarm’s average to have a petition instituted against it, whether in full or in part. It took an average of 191 days to reach the institution decision stage, slightly above the overall average of 188 days. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of the 49 trials instituted, 14 resulted in final written decisions of which 6 resulted in all claims being canceled and 8 had some claims survive; none had all claims survive. The time to reach a final written decision was quicker than the average time, 512.1 days compared to 545.1 days. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The number of petitions in 2020 was smaller than in 2019, with petitions in 2020 only for the months of January, March, and April, perhaps related to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the biggest influx of petitions occurred in January 2020, where 8 petitions were filed by Google, 2 were filed by Ericsson and 2 were filed by Samsung Electronics America.

  "description": "<p>The forced changes in office culture and environment induced\nby the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to stay. This has led many industries to\ncreate virtual collaboration platforms to ensure remote connectivity. Companies\nlike <a href=\"https://tech.fb.com/the-future-of-work-and-the-next-computing-platform/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>\nhave also recently introduced a mixed virtual reality concept, allowing users\nto fully immerse themselves in a digital 3-D workplace through the use of an Oculus\nVR system. However, with increasing remote connectivity comes the question of\nsecuring collected personal data and conforming with existing data privacy and\nprotection laws like the <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">California\nConsumer Protection Act</a> (CCPA). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-becerra-reminds-consumers-their-data-privacy-rights-during\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">alert</a>\nissued by California General Attorney Xavier Becerra, he stressed that our\nincreased “dependency on online connectivity [has made it] more important than\never for Californians to know their privacy rights.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, aims to provide\ntransparency through disclosure requirements for personal data collected. It\nalso targets opt-out/delete options that allow consumers to withdraw their\nconsent to the processing and sale of personal data. The CCPA is applicable to\nbusinesses that satisfy a threshold of annual gross revenue in excess of $25\nmillion; annually buy, sell, receive for commercial purposes the personal\ninformation of 50,000 or more consumers, households, or devices; or derive 50\npercent or more of its annual revenues from selling consumers’ personal\ninformation. Despite the focus of the CCPA being more driven to the consumer\ninteraction during the point of sale, guidance for civil action is provided\nunder 1798.150 when personal information of consumers is subject to\nunauthorized access and exfiltration, theft or disclosure as a result of a\nviolation of the duty to maintain reasonable security procedures and practice\nappropriate to the nature of the information. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a breach, the resulting damages can range in between $100\nand $750 per consumer per incident or actual damage. Thus, the burning question\narises of how businesses can fulfill their duty to maintain reasonable security\nprocedures and practices in a remote working environment. The CCPA remains\nsilent in this regard following an <em>ex post</em> evaluation approach. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For guidance, the Office of the California Attorney General released\nits <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/dbr/2016-data-breach-report.pdf\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">California\nData Breach Report</a>, which offers insight into the most common types of data\nbreaches between 2012 to 2015 and security recommendations. Further, the attorney\ngeneral’s office supports a set of <a href=\"https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-list/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">20 cybersecurity\ndefensive measures</a> that all organizations that collect or maintain personal\ninformation should meet at the bare minimum. These measures were outlined by\nthe Center for Internet Security. However, despite stipulating a minimum level\nof protection, it remains questionable what concrete steps individuals, working\nremotely in a home office environment, can take to provide an additional layer\nof security. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://gdpr-info.eu/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">General Data Protection\nRegulation</a> (GDPR) of the European Union may provide some clarity to this\nmatter. Despite the CCPA and the GDPR being separate legal frameworks with\ndifferent scopes, definitions, and requirements, Art. 32 of the GDPR also\naddresses the security of processing personal data. Unlike the CCPA, the GDPR\nfollows a risk analysis approach to implement appropriate technical and\norganizational measures to ensure security by evaluating the likelihood and\nseverity of violation of the rights and freedoms of natural persons. <em>Inter\nalia, </em>as appropriate, this may include the pseudonymization and encryption\nof personal data; providing ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability,\nand resilience of processing systems and services; timely restoring of personal\ndata; and regular testing of the technical and organizational measures for\nensuring security of the processing. As an interpretation, the following guidelines\nwere released by the German federal data protection officer exclusively for\ncompanies to follow in a remote work setting:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Access to personal information shall be\nsafeguarded by Multi-Factor Authentication </li><li>Connectivity shall be exclusively channeled\nthrough a Virtual Private Network (VPN)</li><li>End-to-end Encryption (E2EE) of personal data\nincluding filing encryption </li><li>Blocking of USB and other access to mobile work\ndevices</li><li>No device connectivity to external printers</li><li>No private use of mobile work devices </li><li>Regular workshops and certifications to\ncybersecurity and data privacy and protection law with mobile devices</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Further suggested security measures that companies shall\nconsider under the GDPR in remote workspaces are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Appointment of designated contact for data\nprotection </li><li>Required validation by employer when using\nprivate mobile devices </li><li>Adequate workspace with an enclosure that can be\nlocked by door and key</li><li>Hardware files should be kept in a sealed\nenclosure </li><li>Data shall be saved on provided cloud servers,\nno physical copies shall be kept by employees </li><li>Immediate destruction of hard copies containing\npersonal information using a shredder </li><li>Activation of automatic screen saver upon\nleaving the workspace </li><li>Banning the forwarding of work emails to private\nmail accounts</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of these measures may seem extreme and costly to\nimplement, but with the enforcement of CCPA beginning it is crucial for\ncompanies to evaluate their need for compliance with the CCPA and maintenance\nof reasonable security practices and procedures. </p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/cybersecurity/ccpa-enforcement-begins-as-data-privacy-issues-in-remote-workspaces-become-clear/\">CCPA Enforcement Begins As Data Privacy Issues in Remote Workspaces  Become Clear</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com\">LawStreetMedia</a>.</p>",

    "#": "<p>The forced changes in office culture and environment induced\nby the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to stay. This has led many industries to\ncreate virtual collaboration platforms to ensure remote connectivity. Companies\nlike <a href=\"https://tech.fb.com/the-future-of-work-and-the-next-computing-platform/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>\nhave also recently introduced a mixed virtual reality concept, allowing users\nto fully immerse themselves in a digital 3-D workplace through the use of an Oculus\nVR system. However, with increasing remote connectivity comes the question of\nsecuring collected personal data and conforming with existing data privacy and\nprotection laws like the <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">California\nConsumer Protection Act</a> (CCPA). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-becerra-reminds-consumers-their-data-privacy-rights-during\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">alert</a>\nissued by California General Attorney Xavier Becerra, he stressed that our\nincreased “dependency on online connectivity [has made it] more important than\never for Californians to know their privacy rights.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, aims to provide\ntransparency through disclosure requirements for personal data collected. It\nalso targets opt-out/delete options that allow consumers to withdraw their\nconsent to the processing and sale of personal data. The CCPA is applicable to\nbusinesses that satisfy a threshold of annual gross revenue in excess of $25\nmillion; annually buy, sell, receive for commercial purposes the personal\ninformation of 50,000 or more consumers, households, or devices; or derive 50\npercent or more of its annual revenues from selling consumers’ personal\ninformation. Despite the focus of the CCPA being more driven to the consumer\ninteraction during the point of sale, guidance for civil action is provided\nunder 1798.150 when personal information of consumers is subject to\nunauthorized access and exfiltration, theft or disclosure as a result of a\nviolation of the duty to maintain reasonable security procedures and practice\nappropriate to the nature of the information. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a breach, the resulting damages can range in between $100\nand $750 per consumer per incident or actual damage. Thus, the burning question\narises of how businesses can fulfill their duty to maintain reasonable security\nprocedures and practices in a remote working environment. The CCPA remains\nsilent in this regard following an <em>ex post</em> evaluation approach. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For guidance, the Office of the California Attorney General released\nits <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/dbr/2016-data-breach-report.pdf\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">California\nData Breach Report</a>, which offers insight into the most common types of data\nbreaches between 2012 to 2015 and security recommendations. Further, the attorney\ngeneral’s office supports a set of <a href=\"https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-list/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">20 cybersecurity\ndefensive measures</a> that all organizations that collect or maintain personal\ninformation should meet at the bare minimum. These measures were outlined by\nthe Center for Internet Security. However, despite stipulating a minimum level\nof protection, it remains questionable what concrete steps individuals, working\nremotely in a home office environment, can take to provide an additional layer\nof security. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://gdpr-info.eu/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">General Data Protection\nRegulation</a> (GDPR) of the European Union may provide some clarity to this\nmatter. Despite the CCPA and the GDPR being separate legal frameworks with\ndifferent scopes, definitions, and requirements, Art. 32 of the GDPR also\naddresses the security of processing personal data. Unlike the CCPA, the GDPR\nfollows a risk analysis approach to implement appropriate technical and\norganizational measures to ensure security by evaluating the likelihood and\nseverity of violation of the rights and freedoms of natural persons. <em>Inter\nalia, </em>as appropriate, this may include the pseudonymization and encryption\nof personal data; providing ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability,\nand resilience of processing systems and services; timely restoring of personal\ndata; and regular testing of the technical and organizational measures for\nensuring security of the processing. As an interpretation, the following guidelines\nwere released by the German federal data protection officer exclusively for\ncompanies to follow in a remote work setting:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Access to personal information shall be\nsafeguarded by Multi-Factor Authentication </li><li>Connectivity shall be exclusively channeled\nthrough a Virtual Private Network (VPN)</li><li>End-to-end Encryption (E2EE) of personal data\nincluding filing encryption </li><li>Blocking of USB and other access to mobile work\ndevices</li><li>No device connectivity to external printers</li><li>No private use of mobile work devices </li><li>Regular workshops and certifications to\ncybersecurity and data privacy and protection law with mobile devices</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Further suggested security measures that companies shall\nconsider under the GDPR in remote workspaces are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Appointment of designated contact for data\nprotection </li><li>Required validation by employer when using\nprivate mobile devices </li><li>Adequate workspace with an enclosure that can be\nlocked by door and key</li><li>Hardware files should be kept in a sealed\nenclosure </li><li>Data shall be saved on provided cloud servers,\nno physical copies shall be kept by employees </li><li>Immediate destruction of hard copies containing\npersonal information using a shredder </li><li>Activation of automatic screen saver upon\nleaving the workspace </li><li>Banning the forwarding of work emails to private\nmail accounts</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of these measures may seem extreme and costly to\nimplement, but with the enforcement of CCPA beginning it is crucial for\ncompanies to evaluate their need for compliance with the CCPA and maintenance\nof reasonable security practices and procedures. </p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/cybersecurity/ccpa-enforcement-begins-as-data-privacy-issues-in-remote-workspaces-become-clear/\">CCPA Enforcement Begins As Data Privacy Issues in Remote Workspaces  Become Clear</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lawstreetmedia.com\">LawStreetMedia</a>.</p>"
